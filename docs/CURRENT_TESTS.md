Summary of Most Recent Operations and System State
üîç Current Architecture Overview
The XOFlowers AI system is built with a sophisticated multi-layered approach:

AI Engine (ai_engine.py) - Main orchestrator that:

Retrieves enhanced conversation context via Gemini chat sessions (with Redis fallback)
Performs AI-powered security validation
Analyzes user intent
Routes to either Gemini Chat or ChromaDB product search
Orchestrates responses intelligently
Gemini Chat Manager (gemini_chat_manager.py) - Handles:

Multi-turn conversations with context preservation
Session management for natural dialogue
Fallback to Redis when Gemini sessions unavailable
ChromaDB Integration (chromadb_client.py) - Provides:

Vector-based product search
Price filtering and category support
Enhanced query optimization
üìä Recent Diagnostic Operations
Based on the conversation summary, you've been running comprehensive integration tests:

test_enhanced_gemini_chromadb.py - Tests the combination of Gemini intent analysis + ChromaDB product search
analyze_chromadb.py - Deep analysis of ChromaDB data and filtering capabilities
debug_chromadb.py - Direct ChromaDB testing and debugging
test_enhanced_integration.py - Full integration testing of AI-driven product search
‚úÖ Confirmed Working Components
‚úÖ Gemini API integration (using gemini-2.5-flash stable model)
‚úÖ ChromaDB product search with vector similarity
‚úÖ AI-powered security validation via Gemini
‚úÖ Enhanced context management (Gemini chat + Redis fallback)
‚úÖ Intent analysis for product vs. conversation routing
‚úÖ Telegram bot connectivity and message processing
üîß Areas Identified for Enhancement
Product Relevance: ChromaDB contains mostly expensive products, affecting search results
Price Filtering: Needs refinement for better budget-based recommendations
Integration Flow: Main AI engine needs the enhanced Gemini+ChromaDB approach from test scripts
üéØ Current State & Next Steps
You're at the point where:

All individual components work correctly
Enhanced integration approach proven in test scripts
Ready to integrate the enhanced approach into the main AI engine
System uses latest Gemini model with proper fallback mechanisms
Security validation and context management are robust
The system is designed to provide no-fallback AI responses where Gemini Chat handles natural conversation while intelligently calling ChromaDB for product-specific queries, exactly as you requested.

Would you like me to help integrate the enhanced Gemini+ChromaDB approach from your test scripts into the main AI engine, or would you prefer to focus on improving the ChromaDB product relevance and filtering first?
