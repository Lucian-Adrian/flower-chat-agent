# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The XOFlowers AI Agent currently operates as a template-based system with rigid intent classification and predefined responses. This approach results in robotic interactions that fail to understand user context and provide personalized responses. We need to rebuild the intelligence layer to create a truly conversational AI that understands natural language, maintains context, and generates personalized responses while having access to product data through semantic search.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Natural Conversational AI

**User Story:** As a customer, I want to have natural conversations with the AI agent, so that I feel like I'm talking to a knowledgeable human florist rather than a robotic system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user sends any message THEN the system SHALL generate natural, contextual responses using AI without relying on predefined templates
2. WHEN a user asks follow-up questions THEN the system SHALL understand the conversation context and respond appropriately
3. WHEN a user uses colloquial language or incomplete sentences THEN the system SHALL understand the intent and respond naturally
4. WHEN a user changes topics mid-conversation THEN the system SHALL adapt smoothly without losing context
5. IF a user asks about flowers in a casual way THEN the system SHALL respond in a conversational tone matching the user's style

### Requirement 2: Semantic Product Search Integration

**User Story:** As a customer, I want the AI to understand what I'm looking for even when I describe it vaguely, so that I can find the perfect flowers without knowing exact product names.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user describes flowers using vague terms like "something romantic" THEN the system SHALL use semantic search to find relevant products
2. WHEN a user mentions an occasion like "anniversary" THEN the system SHALL automatically search for appropriate products and integrate them naturally into the conversation
3. WHEN a user asks about price ranges THEN the system SHALL filter products semantically and present options conversationally
4. WHEN a user describes colors or styles THEN the system SHALL use vector similarity to find matching products
5. IF no exact matches exist THEN the system SHALL suggest similar alternatives and explain why they might work

### Requirement 3: Conversation Memory and Context

**User Story:** As a customer, I want the AI to remember our conversation and my preferences, so that I don't have to repeat myself and get increasingly personalized service.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user mentions their preferences THEN the system SHALL store this information in conversation context
2. WHEN a user refers to "that bouquet we discussed" THEN the system SHALL understand the reference from conversation history
3. WHEN a user returns to the conversation later THEN the system SHALL remember previous interactions and preferences
4. WHEN a user asks follow-up questions THEN the system SHALL maintain context from the entire conversation thread
5. IF a user mentions budget constraints THEN the system SHALL remember this for all subsequent product suggestions

### Requirement 4: ChromaDB Vector Database Setup

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the product data to be properly vectorized and stored in ChromaDB, so that the AI can perform fast semantic searches and find relevant products.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system starts THEN ChromaDB SHALL be initialized with proper collections for products, categories, and metadata
2. WHEN product data is loaded THEN each product SHALL be vectorized using sentence transformers with rich descriptions
3. WHEN performing searches THEN the system SHALL use cosine similarity to find semantically related products
4. WHEN products are updated THEN the vector database SHALL be updated automatically
5. IF the database is corrupted THEN the system SHALL have backup and recovery mechanisms

### Requirement 5: AI-Driven Response Generation

**User Story:** As a customer, I want responses that feel natural and personalized, so that the interaction feels like talking to an expert florist who understands my needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating responses THEN the system SHALL use AI to create natural language that matches the conversation tone
2. WHEN including product information THEN the system SHALL integrate it naturally into conversational responses
3. WHEN a user asks complex questions THEN the system SHALL break down the response in a conversational manner
4. WHEN providing recommendations THEN the system SHALL explain reasoning in a natural, helpful way
5. IF the AI cannot find relevant information THEN it SHALL ask clarifying questions conversationally

### Requirement 6: Context-Aware Product Recommendations

**User Story:** As a customer, I want product recommendations that consider my conversation context and stated preferences, so that suggestions are truly relevant to my needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN making recommendations THEN the system SHALL consider conversation history, stated preferences, and occasion context
2. WHEN a user mentions budget THEN all recommendations SHALL respect the budget constraints
3. WHEN a user indicates preferences for colors or styles THEN recommendations SHALL prioritize matching products
4. WHEN suggesting alternatives THEN the system SHALL explain why they might be suitable based on conversation context
5. IF user preferences conflict THEN the system SHALL ask for clarification conversationally

### Requirement 7: Fallback and Error Handling

**User Story:** As a customer, I want the conversation to continue smoothly even when the AI encounters errors, so that my experience isn't disrupted by technical issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the primary AI service fails THEN the system SHALL fallback to secondary AI service seamlessly
2. WHEN ChromaDB is unavailable THEN the system SHALL inform the user conversationally and offer alternative assistance
3. WHEN the AI cannot understand a query THEN it SHALL ask for clarification in a natural way
4. WHEN technical errors occur THEN the system SHALL handle them gracefully without exposing technical details
5. IF all services fail THEN the system SHALL provide helpful contact information conversationally

### Requirement 8: Multi-turn Conversation Support

**User Story:** As a customer, I want to have extended conversations where each message builds on the previous ones, so that I can explore options and make informed decisions through dialogue.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a conversation spans multiple messages THEN the system SHALL maintain coherent context throughout
2. WHEN a user asks "what about that one?" THEN the system SHALL understand the reference from conversation history
3. WHEN comparing products THEN the system SHALL remember which products were discussed and their characteristics
4. WHEN a user changes their mind THEN the system SHALL adapt recommendations based on new preferences
5. IF a conversation becomes too long THEN the system SHALL summarize key points when helpful
